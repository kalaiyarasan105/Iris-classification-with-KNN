# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project was completed as part of my **AI & ML Internship (Week 3)** with **NSP NEXUS**.

## Objective
To build a classification model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Dataset
The dataset used is the built-in **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains:
- **150 samples**
- **3 classes**: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded Iris dataset from sklearn.
2. Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Visualized the data using Seaborn pairplot.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Applied the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm (k=3).
6. Trained the model and made predictions.
7. Evaluated the model using **accuracy score** and **confusion matrix**.
8. Predicted the species for a new flower sample.

## Model Evaluation
- **Model Used**: KNN with k=3
- Accuracy: ~90-100% (depending on train/test split)
